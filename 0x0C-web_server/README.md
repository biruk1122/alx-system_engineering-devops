1. Install nginx web server
Readme:

-y on apt-get command
Web servers are the piece of software generating and serving HTML pages, let’s install one!

Requirements:

Install nginx on your web-01
server
Nginx should be listening on port 80
When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page) using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Hello World!
As an answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements (this script will be run on the server itself)
You can’t use systemctl for restarting nginx

2. Setup a domain name

At the Checkout step, please click on “Login with GitHub”:
 

The cost of the domain should be now at $0
You can finalize it by creating an account in .Tech domains
And manage your domain there!
Provide the domain name in your answer file.

Requirement:

provide the domain name only (example: foobar.tech), no subdomain (example: www.foobar.tech)
configure your DNS records with an A entry so that your root domain points to your web-01 IP address Warning: the propagation of your records can take time (~1-2 hours)
go to your profile and enter your domain in the Project website url field

3. Redirection
Readme:

Replace a line with multiple lines with sed
Configure your Nginx server so that /redirect_me is redirecting to another page.

Requirements:

The redirection must be a “301 Moved Permanently”
You answer file should be a Bash script containing commands to automatically configure a Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements
Using what you did with 1-install_nginx_web_server, write 3-redirection so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task

4. Not found page 404
Configure your Nginx server to have a custom 404 page that contains the string Ceci n'est pas une page.

Requirements:

The page must return an HTTP 404 error code
The page must contain the string Ceci n'est pas une page
Using what you did with 3-redirection, write 4-not_found_page_404 so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task

5. Install Nginx web server (w/ Puppet)
Time to practice configuring your server with Puppet! Just as you did before, we’d like you to install and configure an Nginx server using Puppet instead of Bash. To save time and effort, you should also include resources in your manifest to perform a 301 redirect when querying /redirect_me.

Requirements:

Nginx should be listening on port 80
When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page) using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Hello World!
The redirection must be a “301 Moved Permanently”
Your answer file should be a Puppet manifest containing commands to automatically configure an Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements
