Tasks
0. OSI model
mandatory
OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.

It is organized from the lowest level to the highest level:

The lowest level: layer 1 which is for transmission on physical layers with electrical impulse, light or radio signal
The highest level: layer 7 which is for application specific communication like SNMP for emails, HTTP for your web browser, etc
Keep in mind that the OSI model is a concept, it’s not even tangible. The OSI model doesn’t perform any functions in the networking process. It is a conceptual framework so we can better understand complex interactions that are happening. Most of the functionality in the OSI model exists in all communications systems.

In this project we will mainly focus on:

The Transport layer and especially TCP/UDP
On the Network layer with IP and ICMP
The image bellow describes more concretely how you can relate to every level.

Questions:

What is the OSI model?

Set of specifications that network hardware manufacturers must respect
The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology
The OSI model is a model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system with a strong regard for their underlying internal structure and technology
How is the OSI model organized?

1. Types of network
LAN connect local devices together, WAN connects LANs together, and WANs are operating over the Internet.

Questions:

What type of network a computer in local is connected to?

Internet
WAN
LAN
What type of network could connect an office in one building to another office in a building a few streets away?

Internet
WAN
LAN
What network do you use when you browse www.google.com from your smartphone (not connected to the Wifi)?

Internet
WAN
LAN


2. MAC and IP address
Questions:

What is a MAC address?

The name of a network interface
The unique identifier of a network interface
A network interface
What is an IP address?

Is to devices connected to a network what postal address is to houses
The unique identifier of a network interface
Is a number that network devices use to connect to networks


3. UDP and TCP
Let’s fill the empty parts in the drawing above.

Questions:

Which statement is correct for the TCP box:
It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely
It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process
Which statement is correct for the UDP box:
It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely
It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process
Which statement is correct for the TCP worker:
Have you received boxes x, y, z?
May I increase the rate at which I am sending you boxes?

5. Is the host on the network
The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a protocol in the Internet protocol suite. It is used by network devices, to check if other network devices are available on the network. The command ping uses ICMP to make sure that a network device remains online or to troubleshoot issues on the network.

Write a Bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument.

Requirements:

Accepts a string as an argument
Displays Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS} if no argument passed
Ping the IP 5 times
It is interesting to look at the time value, which is the time that it took for the ICMP request to go to the 8.8.8.8 IP and come back to my host. The IP 8.8.8.8 is owned by Google, and the quickest roundtrip between my computer and Google was 7.57 ms which is pretty fast, which is a sign that the network path between my computer and Google’s datacenter is in good shape. A slow ping would indicate a slow network.

Next time you feel that your connection is slow, try the ping command to see what is going on!
